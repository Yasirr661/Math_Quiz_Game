This code is a **quiz game** that generates arithmetic questions of different types and levels for the user to solve. It also provides the user with three answer choices, one of which is correct. The user is given five rounds to answer the questions. After each round, if the user has correctly answered three questions, they move on to the next level. The code consists of four functions: show_question, generate_operator, get_possible_wrong_answers, and choices.
